I ran out of space on a docker volume on a windows host. It was 3GB. I looked around briefly how to add more space but it seemed like too much effort.

So I thought I'd just mount to the host file system and get 100GB of available space. 

I'm working with postgres and I didn't want to lose my data. Docker copy seemed like a good enough solution.

It looked like I may need to create a new volume. I couldn'tn find a way to resize. I am just hacking around and wanted something quick with minimal effort. Didn't want to deal with WSL config or anything either.

You have to have the container running I think to get access to the volume but I ddin't look into this.

`docker cp my-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data c:\Users\me\my-mount`
