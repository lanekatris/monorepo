I'm in the search for finding outdoor trails and points of interest. Alltrails seems sweet with PRO but I can't easily export data to my knowledge.

I already use GAIA but their trail finding sucks. 

Mountain project rocks for rock climbing but hiking projects doesn't for hiking. So I think AllTrails wins out.

Hiking project has a nice top rated though: https://www.hikingproject.com/featured/hikes/top-rated
