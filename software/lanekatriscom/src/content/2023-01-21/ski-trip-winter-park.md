# Post Trip

I was more organized around the airport this time. I've had lots of things in my pockets before. This did make me think about "pouches". So I got one for my nalgene and another one to keep in my bag for nic nacks. I'll update on what I think of the two.

Our drivers side front low beams went out. We bought bulbs in North Carolina but I haven't changed them yet. From the few Youtube vidoes I've watched it seems like a lot of effort so I'm good on all that for now.

## Kids

My son didn't get much sleep most nights which caused us not to get much sleep. Little hellion:

## Disc Golf

It was great to go from chillier Colorado mountain weather to 80s in NC. We played at these courses:

* TODO
* Rolling Pines TODO udisc link

Our last day, Sunday, before heading home; we were finishing up and a local NC outdoors TODO interviewed some of us!

So that was neat. Spread some love for the sport from some non-locals.
