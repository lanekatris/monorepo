## Notes

I rolled my ankle on a hill, almost severely

For some reason our power supply mentioned below wasn't being charged by the car. I need to figure out if it is the DC outlet from the car or something with the power supply

I updated my post adventure To Dos to remind me to upload my Udisc CSV. I also made a To Do to share my Obsidian templates with this blog

I forgot my fancy Norwex wash cloth but it wasn't a problem, the hotel of course had wash cloths

Forgot to download Netflix shows like Blippi, maybe I should make a To Do for pre-adventures to do this

Bought this [phone holder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CH14PBX9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) for navigation and it made things so easy:

We brought [the fridge](https://www.dometic.com/en-us/outdoor/coolers/electric-coolers/dometic-cfx3-45-220582) and it was great, especially for our Toddler's milk:

We use a [power supply](https://us.ecoflow.com/products/delta-2-220w-portable-solar-panel?variant=40142843773001#&gid=1&pid=01) in-between the fridge and the car outlet to keep the fridge going when the car is off: (we don't use solar)
