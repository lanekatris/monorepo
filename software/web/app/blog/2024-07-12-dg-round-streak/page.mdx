### Determining a scoring streak and if it's the first time playing a course from your disc golf rounds

I import my disc golf rounds from Udisc via CSV and display them [here](https://live.lkat.io/dg/rounds). I wanted to know when I was on a scoring streak; which I define as: 2 consecutive rounds where I shoot under par.

(Using Postgres) Here is Udisc's CSV format:
```sql
create table if not exists udisc_scorecard
(
    playername  varchar(255),
    coursename  varchar(255),
    layoutname  varchar(255),
    startdate   timestamp,
    enddate     timestamp,
    total       integer,
    "+/-"       integer,
    roundrating integer,
    hole1       integer,
    hole2       integer,
    hole3       integer,
    hole4       integer,
    hole5       integer,
    hole6       integer,
    hole7       integer,
    hole8       integer,
    hole9       integer,
    hole10      integer,
    hole11      integer,
    hole12      integer,
    hole13      integer,
    hole14      integer,
    hole15      integer,
    hole16      integer,
    hole17      integer,
    hole18      integer,
    hole19      integer,
    hole20      integer,
    hole21      integer,
    hole22      integer,
    hole23      integer,
    hole24      integer,
    hole25      integer,
    hole26      integer,
    hole27      integer,
    hole28      integer,
    hole29      integer,
    hole30      integer,
    id          serial
);
```

Here is the query to get each round and if it is a streak or not:
```sql
with x as (select row_number() over (
    partition by coursename
    order by startdate
    ) = 1               new_course,
                  lag("+/-", 1) over (
                      order by startdate
                      ) previous_score,
                  *
           from kestra.udisc_scorecard
           where playername = 'Lane'
           order by startdate desc)
select previous_score < 0 and "+/-" < 0 streak, * from x
```

**Notes**
- Udisc gives you at least 2 rows per round, one for Par and one with your name. You must filter by your name since that is what you scored
- I needed to know the "previous row's" data to know how I scored in that round; that is where `lag` comes in. The sorting I imagine you'd want to match your outer query to match. The partitioning
