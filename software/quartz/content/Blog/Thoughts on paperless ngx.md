I really want to use it. 

For example I hosted via docker and I'm using the web app on my phone. I take a picture of my glasses prescription. 

I can now search for it and the attachment/image is now a first class citizen!

Normally I would attach to a note in obsidian. I'd have to take the mental organization power up front, along with the mediocre image adding capability in Obsidian. 

Compared to dumping into paperless, and if I need it I need it, I can do a search and it comes up. 

Tradeoffs
- They would be different apps (Obsidian and Paperless NGX)


Outcome
I'm not using it for now until I have more of a need, this doesn't come up too often... for now. I have plenty of other projects.
