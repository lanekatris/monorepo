I wanted to consider self hosting https://openfreemap.org/ when learning about: [[Maps in Obsidian!]]

I see it needs 500GB of SSD disk space (recommended). Totally makes sense as it hosts a TON of images. I don't want to get into this right now. 

It's fantastic they have free hosting and I'll use that in obsidian for now.
