Having a `blog` folder isn't enough.

On one hand it seems simple to have a flat list of notes.

This breaks down when I need to reference "gear". i.e. things like my kayak, tent, sleeping bag, etc.

Or where do I put GPS coordinates for camp sites? Frontmatter in obsidian and show it in a base or use a 3rd party app like Gaia?

Another problem is spreadsheet data. What if I want to sum a column of numbers? Makes me think of Grist.
