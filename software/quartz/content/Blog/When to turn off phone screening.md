On my [[Pixel 6 Pro]] I get wayy too many spam calls.

For some reason, the normal Google Fi setting to block spam doesn't work. I've used it in the past:

After getting irritated and giving up, a Redditor said use the "Call" app screening:

Works great, although, make sure to turn **off** this screening when you are at the hospital for a loved one and are awaiting a call from the hospital.

No need to have  that friction when they are trying to call you to pick them up.
