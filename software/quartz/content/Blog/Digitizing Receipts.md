I don't like the upfront cognitive load of digitizing receipts. 

I'm using Obsidian to keep within the bounds of my workflows and as few apps as possible. It is really a lot of friction to take a picture and add it to Obsidian.

So I thought maybe it is time for [Paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/) to do this for me. I then thought, wait, the search on Immich is awesome. Could it do good enough to search?

It does pretty well searching for "receipt". Now searching the contents of the receipts is a different story, it doesn't do that. But I don't really have a need for that.

So for now, I'll just snap a picture and go on my way. I sync to my self hosted Immich server periodically. Although, it is time to update, my version is wayy behind.
