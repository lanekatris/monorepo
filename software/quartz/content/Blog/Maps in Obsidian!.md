My Google feed turned me onto showing [maps in Obisidan](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/views/map), which is very intriguing. I literally have a project on how to deal with points of interest and visualize things - I was looking at [QGIS](https://qgis.org/).

I then found Obsidian had a change log: https://obsidian.md/changelog/2025-10-01-desktop-v1.10.0/ so I followed it via RSS in [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/). 

So I tried to get the community plugin, but I needed to restart to get the latest update. After that I looked up a note I had that I want to visualize on the map: [[National Park - Mammoth Cave]]. On Google maps you can right click the point and get coordinates:

I then used my base [[Everythingbase1.base#adventure plans]] and added a text property with the values.

Dark mode is hard to read I'll admin, but whatever, it's beautiful:

I want to follow up on https://openfreemap.org/. I think I may want to self host.
