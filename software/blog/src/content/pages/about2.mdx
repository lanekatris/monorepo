# Professional



I&apos;m a software engineer. I care about delivering a product that gives value. Taking
requirements and architecting solutions from a full stack perspective is my bread and butter.
I&apos;m always trying to learn and be open minded.

# Fun

You may gather that I like [disc golf](/disc-golf):

I also enjoy ultimate frisbee, rock climbing, paintball,
basketball, etc. The vast majority of my activities are disc golf related.

# Last 5 Podcasts Listened To

I was listening to the [Modern Wisdom podcast](https://chriswillx.com/podcast/), I forget which episode, which mentioned:

> You can find out a lot about someone by seeing their last 5 podcasts...

So I thought I'd show this metric since it is an easy filter from my [feed](/feed):

{feed.filter(x => x.type === 'podcast-completed').slice(0,5).map(x => <li>{x.data.podcast.displayTitle}</li>)}
