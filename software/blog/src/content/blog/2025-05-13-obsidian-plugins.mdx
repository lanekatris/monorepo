### Full Calendar

Used for viewing and adding physical activities on a full calendar view.

This creates files within a folder. I have a separate process that loads these markdown files into a database for querying.

### Day Planner

Shows my work calendars and integrates with my daily note to time block my tasks that need done.

I haven't gotten this (my personal workflow) working with my other locations where I keep tasks.

If I could show the activities from Full Calendar here I would so I'd only need one plugin. Also, Day planner doesn't have a monthly view, I really like that to see activities across a month.

### Web Viewer

I usually don't use this, I find myself opening links in my default browser instead. What this is good for is having a tab for time tracking. I use Toggle.

Spreadsheets are a whole other conversation, but for spreadsheet use cases Obsidian falls short for me. So, for finances I have a tab that is an Excel online spreadsheet.
