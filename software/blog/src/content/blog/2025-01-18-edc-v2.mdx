# Overview

Taking learnings from my [v1 EDC](/blog/2025-01-18-edc-v1) I'm slimmer and fixed a few issues I had:

# Changes from v1

**Added**

1. Matches
1. New pouch

**Removed**

1. Bits
1. Old pouch
1. Kershaw pocket knife (just need 3D printed one)
1. Keyrings - never used them

# Thoughts

**Good**

I can quickly access the knife and pen because of the external pouch sleeves is nice. No need to have them loose in my pocket

Moving the flashlight to loosely in my pocket has helped make it not turn on accidentally and I find its much quicker to use than my phone light (obvious but still)

I removed unneeded bits

I added matches because sometimes I need to start a fire at my dads. They were tiny and lightweight; and I didn't have a mini Bic lighter so this one won out

**Bad**

None for now...
