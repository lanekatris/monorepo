# Overview

For latter part of 2024 I was using this [EDC](/edc):

<BestImage image={one} width={400} alt="Everything I was keeping on me, excluding car key" />
<br />

<BestImage image={three} width={400} alt="Pouch with everything in it" />
<br />

<BestImage image={two} width={400} alt="Everything outside pouch" />

# Thoughts

**Good**

The wallet is great, will give more details in the future TODO

Having a knife in my pocket helped a lot. It was weird, I never realized how much time I spent looking for scissors when I now can use the knife in my pocket

My knife is very lightweight and the magnets make it double as a fidget spinner

Since I climb I'm weird about my fingernails, so it's really useful to have fingernail clippers

Having a screwdriver has helped a few times working on toys

**Bad**

The pouch was heavy

Way too many drill bits

Flashlight keeps getting turned on accidentally

Lost pen
