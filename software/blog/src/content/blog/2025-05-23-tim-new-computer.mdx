Got it off of Newegg for $1,930 [here](https://www.newegg.com/abs-stratos-ruby-gaming-desktop-geforce-rtx-5070-amd-ryzen-7-7700x-32gb-ddr5-1tb-pcie-ssd-sr7700x50702-black/p/N82E16883360781). He wanted a RTX 5070 and the budget was ~ $2K. I got an ABS prebuilt for myself years ago because it was the only way to get a newer video card at the time. Since I had a lot of luck with it I recommended it to him.

The techy part of me doesn't feel bad about not building from scratch. I think he got decent bang for the buck.

I think he'll run out of storage at some point, so I wanted to bookmark these M2 Samsung drives: https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100011693%2050001077
