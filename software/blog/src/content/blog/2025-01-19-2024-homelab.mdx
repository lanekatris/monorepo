# Why?

I'm a software engineer and I have a ton of interests and ideas I want to experiment with. Quite a few of those need an always running infrastructure.

I may be cheap... for certain things. So self-hosting can be cheaper.

I get irritated with certain SAAS' and want to do it myself.

I don't want too much infrastructure overhead though.

I want to capture data that existing SAAS' don't do.

**Data**

I want to see data over time. I like the numbers. I want to record data and improve personal workflows.

# My Setup

<BestImage image={homelab} width={400} alt="Overview of my setup (generated with Obsidian.md)" />

## Neon.tech Postgres

I use the cloud hosted free plan mainly because:

1. I don't have to upgrade maintain infrastructure
1. Cheap/free
1. Easy cloud service integrations need access to a public hosted database
1. I'm within the free limits
