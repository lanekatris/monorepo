Took a quick trip at the tail end of my PTO chasing some warmish weather.

So not too healthy... but trying to make traveling easier. This is a fridge basket for our Dometic CFX3 45 fridge.

At Lake Reidsville I threw a forehand zone into the hollowed out tree above. The left image is no zoom and the right is
zoomed in.

The playground and campground looked great at Lake Reidsville.

The "zoo" (Science Center) was a big success for the family. Would recommend. The treehouses with dinosaurs were such a
good idea... and
free.

This hand warmer is great, not sure what brand it is. Also, somebody is getting tired...

The Springwood course was alright for a Blue difficulty. Worth playing once.

While at the Ruckus climbing gym I saw some awesome
chairs: [Melino Wooden Folding Chair](https://www.costco.com/melino-wooden-folding-chair.product.100768979.html).
