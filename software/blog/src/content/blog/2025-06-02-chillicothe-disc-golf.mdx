# Overview
Went to 3 new courses for a day trip! Scorecards [here](/disc-golf)

# [Black Bear](https://udisc.com/courses/black-bear-TKzx)

- Not cart friendly!
- Found someones disc
- No service, Udisc doesn't work too well so the map is below
- I didn't mind the cairn as it was a forehand hole
- Ohio got a lot of rain, I don't think normally the teepad would be flooded

# [Veterans Memorial @ Liberty Park](https://udisc.com/courses/veterans-memorial-liberty-park-RdRu)

- This course had the longest walk between holes I've ever experienced
- Some long par 3s
- It was cool to hop on the rocks to get to the basket
