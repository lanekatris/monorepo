# Before NixOS

My last linux distro I was using was [[popos]]. I like the idea of distro hopping but I actually don't want to spend time on getting a new machine ready to develop on. 

My machines where I run linux (more here: <a href="/homelab">homelab</a>):
1. Server
2. Main desktop
3. Cheap laptop

Some problems I'm facing: 
1. I'm terrible at keeping my server up to date
2. My desktop I dual boot with Windows for gaming (pretty infrequent)
