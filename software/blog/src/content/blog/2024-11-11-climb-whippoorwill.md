Went climbing on 2024-11-09 at [Whippoorwill](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106010457/whippoorwill)!

I updated my ticks on [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/7079884/lane-katris/ticks) but added a page to my website [here](/ticks).

I went with Ian and Gene but took no pictures ðŸ˜¢

# Post-Trip Notes

- Did not have to poop while at the crag ðŸŽ‰
- Didn't bring
    - Cooler
    - Sweet or caffeine drink
    - Snickers
    - EDC Pouch
- The cashews and squeeze peanut butter were nice
- Get pepperoni rolls for food in the future
- My climb books are old, need to update
- I didn't use my eye glasses
- I found that wag bags are expensive, I'd never heard of them until there was a box on the trail head
- I'd like to learn how to rappel 
- Took flip-flops but didn't use them
- Sunscreen was a good idea
- Instead of Nalgenes or a jug I brought my bladder. It was nice, just no trees; so had to bend down a lot
