We started our local volleyball league: [[Started 2025 Winter and Spring Local Volleyball League]]

We decided to record video to review. 

I recorded 28 GB on the GoPro which came out to be roughly 10 split up files my main use cases are let others watch the video expose the video files to a friend in case he wants to edit we learned where we couldn't see the left server we played music way too close to the GoPro so that's all you could hear that also causes a copyright bag on YouTube but that doesn't matter so I tried to self host jellyfin can you use a tailscale funnel tunnel for videos against the TOs My Home Server doesn't have a video card so streaming it was packing my CPU and the telescope funnel command isn't meant to be running all the time so I use ffmpeg to combine all the files and put it on YouTube so that solves the letting others watch the video use case I still haven't decided on making the files available I want to sell post but I may have to get into port forwarding I could copy to a cloud bucket give the links to my buddy and they Auto expire after 10 days I thought about making a temporal workflow to remove the GoPro lrm files combine the files potentially upload Pearl Andorra bucket because this will be happening every week ideally I may be getting the horse in front of the cart vice versa butt it's fun to think about this also got me thinking about the side quest of a scorekeeper with big arcade buttons and a larger 7 segment display cuz our friends bring one but it's on the smaller side and it's hard to see in the sunlight now that we're indoors it'll probably work but it uses an RFID remote where you have to point it perfectly at it so that is less than ideal thought about using a GoPro I mean a Raspberry Pi and like a monitor all that and I like a web page and that seems not a satisfying thinking about some big fat 100 mm buttons and a 7 second display hopefully large potentially a sound plays but at least the button lights up when you hit it to know that you scored and it's simple and fast for people to Market Square

i plugged in for power as batteries suck

2.4k at 60fps seemed to be grainy
