I like to do a lot of activities. As I get older and have a family I need to be a bit more structured so I don't forget things and try to spend brain energy where it needs to be.

I've always wanted to keep track of all this and I wanted to start somewhere simple.

Volleyball is simple, ~2 pieces of gear needed. Simple. So I created a new page: [Loadouts](/loadouts).
