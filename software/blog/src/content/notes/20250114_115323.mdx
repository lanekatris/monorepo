I don't know for a fact if the SD card is hosed, but I saw an article for this error:

> Warning: File system check failed but did not detect errors

I know it seems hasty to swap for a new SD but the make and model was mentioned in the article to behave this way when
its wore out. I don't want to have to deal with these things and I had a spare :)
