	<h1>Professional</h1>
	<p>
		I&apos;m a software engineer. I care about delivering a product that gives value. Taking
		requirements and architecting solutions from a full stack perspective is my bread and butter.
		I&apos;m always trying to learn and be open minded.

	<h1>Fun</h1>
	<p>
		I also enjoy <a href="/disc-golf">disc golf</a>, ultimate frisbee, rock climbing, paintball,
		basketball, etc. The vast majority of my activities are disc golf related.

	<p>
		I live in West Virginia. Although it may be a poor state and folks confuse it with &quot;western
		virginia&quot;... it is a beautiful place. Also, not a bad place to raise your children. To be
		fair though: I dream of Colorado a plenty.
