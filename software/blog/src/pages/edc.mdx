				Since I lost my [Everyman](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNWJN7RV) pen I got this one for far cheaper: $10.
				<br />
				I'm using my typical ink in it, but it seems like it will do the job!
				<br />
				The click top isn't ideal for the pocket, but this one is harder to push. So I don't find it clicking
				unintentionally in my pocket.
