### File Name Sanitizer
[File Name Sanitizer](/sanitizer) just takes a filename and removes spaces and other junk

I added this beacuse when you download from DALL-E it gives you your search term along with date all with spaces and other characters. So instead of googling or manually editing the filename each time this was added. 

### GPS Submitter

[GPS Submitter](/gps) - Sometimes you just need to send off your coordinates for later processing (requires a token to talk to my cloud function)

### Events

[Events](/events) - An easy way to create data points I care about

### Discs

[Discs](/discs) - My disc golf disc database
