# Ski Trip 2022 - Copper Mountain

:::danger

Articles will say _Skiing_ but that is because that is the universal description of the sport. I **Snowboard**, the one true and proper snow sports version

:::

:::info

This was the first time snowboarding out west. I've only been to [Snowshoe](https://www.snowshoemtn.com/) ([üìç](https://goo.gl/maps/NeJq2b4hZXqxiwTr6))  and other nearby resorts

### Why Copper Mountain?

We had the family (wife and TODO year old) with us and they didn't ski 

It's close to the interstate so not really any issue traveling to it

### Why Colorado

### Lessons Learned

#### Altitude sickness or a bug
Our flight was late and we ate in Denver. When we drove on route todo Troy and I fell asleep. So who knows what caused it but both my todo year old and I were sick so I had a late start the next day.

#### Popped Tire

#### Unable to do the stupid lift
