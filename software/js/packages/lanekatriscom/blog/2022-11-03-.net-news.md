# Keeping up with the .NET ecosystem

I came across https://dusted.codes/ from reddit which directed me to https://dotnetketchup.com/ which is a .NET only news feed. I saw a few links from hacker news on there.

I have nothing **against** this idea or the .NET ecosystem but I feel like it's not a good idea to follow this feed in particular compared to a general hacker news. 

I think it is a great community, but for me, I don't want to pigeon hole myself by keeping up with things in the .NET space. I think it's far more valuable to follow hacker news or general software feeds instead.
