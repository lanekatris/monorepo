We will be discussing why we even need to distribute a database across multiple machines, what are leaders and followers, how to handle the failure of leaders and followers, etc. It will set it up nicely for our future blog in this series. Why distribute a database across multiple machines? Scalability - If your data volume, read load, or write load grows larger than what a single machine can handle, you can spread the load across multiple machines High availability - If your application needs to continue to serve even if one or more machines goes down, you can use multiple machines to give you redundancy/ fault tolerance.",

Magic happened when this beautiful place named \"Rock City Gardens\" was opened to the public in 1932. In 1947 Frieda, along with artist Jessie Sanders started drilling through the rock to create Fairyland Caverns! There is a historical landmark where you can \"see seven States\". I'm not sure how accurate this is but the view is breathtaking! Inside you'll find rows of 3-D dioramas of fairytale scenes and an incredible Mother Goose village display at the end. This place gave me so much happiness and nostalgia. If you love fairytales, this is definitely the place to visit! I honestly don't think there's anything like it! The whole experience of walking through the gardens, stones bridges, waterfalls, a swinging bridge and then ending up at the Fairytale Caverns is truly amazing 💛.

Several sections are a lil hairy as you climb vertical ladders and hike cliffside but for me (note: im comfortable with heights and have hiked for years) the payout is more than worth it.  You get epic 360 degree views for as far as the eye can see from Macrae Peak. Next time I go I will do the entire thing to Calloway Peak but I had some time constraints on this particular day. It took me a lil under two hours to do this section and it was well worth it!  For me this is one of, if not my absolute favorite NC hike, right up there with some iconic hikes in the Gorge and blue lines to waterfalls off the Parkway. Whaat’s your favorite hike?
