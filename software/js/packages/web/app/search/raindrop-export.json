The 2.4 mile long Grandfather Trail is recommended for experienced hikers and for good reason. Several sections are a lil hairy as you climb vertical ladders and hike cliffside but for me (note: im comfortable with heights and have hiked for years) the payout is more than worth it.  You get epic 360 degree views for as far as the eye can see from Macrae Peak. Next time I go I will do the entire thing to Calloway Peak but I had some time constraints on this particular day. It took me a lil under two hours to do this section and it was well worth it!  For me this is one of, if not my absolute favorite NC hike, right up there with some iconic hikes in the Gorge and blue lines to waterfalls off the Parkway. Whaat’s your favorite hike?
