When I was growing up I didn't have a ton of kids my age in my rural area. I did hang out with my adult neighbors, one being Terry Campbell

I actually built a desktop PC for him when I was young. I helped him with various IT things; he was always ripping ðŸ“€s and needed more hard drive space ðŸ“ˆ

_He paid me too_! Obviously that is a big deal when attending high school. I tried to refuse payment various times but he insisted ðŸ’µ

## âŒ› Time Can Be So Short

This is a sticky note I made to remind me to visit him when I heard an ambulance had picked him up and learned he wasn't doing well

> 3 days later he passed away

_I didn't get to visit him in time_

Just don't forget how little time people _could_ have left; __especially your parents__ ðŸ’”
