# The Old Site

> I've had previous iterations of my website but don't have any screenshots of them ðŸ™„

# What Triggered This?

Well [indie blog](https://indieblog.page/) and [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) caused this. That is a good thing though

Sometimes reading [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/my) gets boring. It's nice to see people's unique personal websites that are software/design/etc. focused

# Goals

- I want it to be pretty
- I would like to scroll through it to reminisce
- Central place for SSR type site along with auth guarded pages for server side getting data
- The above helps with all my random projects too

# Thoughts

I thought about rolling with this [theme](https://github.com/thelearn-tech/hacker-theme) but [Meraki UI](https://merakiui.com/) won out on the theme battle with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

I decided to just do Articles, use [Mastadon](https://mastodon.social/web/@lkat) for Notes, and I'll add filters for the type of posts so the feed isn't too noisy for folks.
I also use Airtable to keep track of outdoor activities so I want to display some graph data on here. Airtable does it well but I'm also cheap and it's fun to mess with your own data

# Inspiration

These blogs were fun to check out:

# Handling Images

If you search for _best practices_ for image handling on Vercel or Netlify you won't get much. They have components that render things performantly but what I wanted to know was storing them?

I didn't want to clutter up my `git` repo with 6MB+ images

So, as "real" companies do I put them in a storage bucket and put a CDN in front of it

# My Workflow

Folks have content on their sites but don't talk much on _how it got there_ or _their workflow_. So I'll touch on that briefly:

- Create a date prefixed `mdx` file with my favorite IDE [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
- (Optional) The FontMatter section at the top of the file, I add `draft: true` when I don't want it published
- Open my file explorer to my [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/) images
- Mount my S3 bucket for any images I may add for an article with this command:

<SyntaxHighlighter style="a11y-dark" language="powershell">
  rclone mount s3:lkat-blog S: --vfs-cache-mode full
</SyntaxHighlighter>

For the `rclone` setup mentioned above you can go see [this article](https://blog.spikeseed.cloud/mount-s3-as-a-disk/#mounting-an-s3-bucket-on-windows-server-2016) which mounts your
`S3` bucket as a local mount using `rclone` which I think is easiest compared to the AWS console and uploading assets there; you just have to remember the mount command

### Hot Reloading

Hot reloading `MDX` is a must, I recently got that working with the following:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="powershell">
  {`cd C:\\Code\\monorepo\\software\\js
.\\node_modules\\.bin\\next-remote-watch ./posts -r .\\apps\\lkat`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

# Technology Choice

It all comes down to the bigger picture for me. I've gone through various iterations with Gatsby, plain CRA, and SSR setups like NestJS

So it seems like Next.js can do SPA and SSR things so...

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: 0,
    paddingBottom: '56%',
    position: 'relative',
  }}

I do miss how GatsbyJS gives you all the querying, aggregation, and unifying api to access your source data though

But overall I think the unified UI components, SSR, and authentication possibilities on certain pages was the selling point for Next.js

Also, for data access, I could have separate cloud functions but why bother when Next.js has `api` that makes it so easy. Plus these endpoints can be locked down

# Improvements Needed

- I currently do manual image resizing ðŸ˜¢ and have to figure out the ratio [here](https://www.inchcalculator.com/video-aspect-ratio-calculator/)

### Tailwind CSS

I don't know all the Tailwind CSS classes so I usually always need to have these open for inspiration/examples:

- [https://merakiui.com/components/](https://merakiui.com/components/)
