# The Old Site

TODO: _There was a few previous iterations actually but I don't have screenshots readily available_

# What Triggered This?
Well indie blog caused this. That is a good thing though.

Sometimes feedly (productivity link to come) gets boring. It's nice to see people's unique personal webistes that are software/design/etc. focused.

# Goals
- I want it to be pretty
- I would like to scroll through it to reminisce (similart to TODO)
- Central place for SSR type site along with auth guarded pages for server side getting data

I thought about rolling with this [theme](https://github.com/thelearn-tech/hacker-theme) but [Meraki UI](https://merakiui.com/) won out on the theme battle with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Since I like maps and outdoor activities the topo background was a no-brainer.

I plan on using "Article" and "Notes" separation and combining them in a central feed you can filter. I also use Airtable to keep track of outdoor activities so I want to display some graph data on here.Airtable does it well but I'm also cheap and it's fun to mess with your own data.

# Handling Images
If you search for _best practices_ for image handling on Vercel or Netlify you won't get much. They have components that render things performantly but what I wanted to know was storing them?

I didn't want to clutter up my `git` repo with 6MB+ images.

So, as "real" companies do I put them in a storage bucket and put a CDN in front of it. See below for how I use it in my workflow.

# My Workflow
Folks have content on their sites but don't talk much on _how it got there_. So I'll touch on that briefly:

- Create a date prefixed `mdx` file
- Open a Chrome tab with my private [S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/lkat-blog)
- Drag and drop images to S3 and build out image link in markdown

Or you can use [this article](https://blog.spikeseed.cloud/mount-s3-as-a-disk/#mounting-an-s3-bucket-on-windows-server-2016) which mounts your
`S3` bucket as a local mount using `rclone` which I think is easier; you just have to remember the mount command.

Hot reloading `MDX` is a must, I'm working on that.

# Technology Choice
It all comes down to the bigger picture for me. I've gone through various iterations TODO

Next.JS

I do miss how GatsbyJS gives you all the  querying, aggregation, unifying api to access your source post examples.

But overall I think the unified UI components, SSR, and authentication possibilities on certain pages was the selling point for Next.js.
Also with data access, I could have separate cloud functions but why bother when Next.js has `api` that makes it so easy. Plus these endpoints can be locked down.
