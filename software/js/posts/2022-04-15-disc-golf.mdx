# Beware
There isn't much water at the start of the course. Towards the latter half you get closer to the ponds. The creeks have been dry from what I've seen.

We have a smaller dog, a french bull dog, and the ridge circled below is hard for him to get back out if he plops in:

Props to [Beast and Buckle](https://beastandbuckle.com/collections/reversible-harnesses) for their harness and my easy retrieval of the doggo!
