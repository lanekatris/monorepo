# No Pictures?

Unfortunately none because there was just two of us. I did drop some pins on GAIA GPS so we don't walk too far next time.

# Ticks

Here is a [list](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/7079884/lane-katris/ticks), I plan on consuming this data myself and doing some charting but I'm in the midst of re-doing this website and figuring out how to easily pull this off:

- [bullocks](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/107159897/bullocks)
- [sausage](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106562033/sausage)

# Highlights

- Back injury is doing much better
- Did a warm up on a 5.9
- Worked on a 5.11c (5.11b on Mountain Project)
- Caught a big fall
- Had to use a bailout beener (so you can assume we didn't finish `sausage`)
- Low climb count but worked on my hardest difficulty to date outside
- Nobody was around in our section of the crag which is good for a few reasons
- Had a ton of laughs and random conversations
- Remembered to eat and hydrate so energy was decent
- Food and beer was great @ [Freefolk brewery](https://freefolkbrew.com/)

# Takeaways

- Need to work on locking off
- Take more falls (although I was recovering from my back injury so I was weary about that)
- Get to [Water Stone Outdoors](https://waterstoneoutdoors.com/) a bit earlier to get coffee
- Wanted to get outside to light a fire on getting after it in the gym... definitely accomplished that

<Alert message='Seeing new "No Trespassing" signs up, seems like more friction is building for these established climbing areas on private land ðŸ¤·' />
