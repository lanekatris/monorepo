It's nice to have a central place that lasts the test of time that is searchable when you want to look for past trips.

If your like me you change a note taking application frequently. You don't want to dump everything from each system either or the previous system didn't conver to the exact format you wanted.

But when you have one in git and a website that renders it, it's a bit easier to get to.
