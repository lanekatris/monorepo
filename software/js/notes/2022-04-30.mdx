I looked into [Amazon Quantum Ledger Database](https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/) thinking I could use it as a hosted event sourcing database but I misunderstood it's use cases.

It seems it shows you latest state, and then you can review all the history for any changes against that state.

So not quite what I was looking for ðŸ¤·
