### Engaging Hips

I've been trying to figure this out because of injuries. My neck keeps getting hurt. This is becuause I'm throwing with all arm power, not using my lower half. I also have had back injuries; although the root issue with my back was an injury from another sport.

Yesterday (2022-11-27) I got out after not playing for a while on a  pretty day and tried to work on it. I got a little bit of the mechanics but definately it isn't put together.
I think regardless the warm up was good; since I **have to warm up** to prevent injury. I noticed the next morning, my glutes and hips were a bit tight, slightly sore. I think this is great, showing I was engaging them somewhat. Even if it was just in the warm up ðŸ˜‰

As I figure out more about this, I'll try to  document some useful notes
