It's nice when a recruiter messages with an interesting subject. I recently got some emails containing these:

- Don't You... Forget About Me
- Can I get that apple pie recipe?

Compared to the negative facets of some communication like short or cryptic messages on LinkedIn where job descriptions or a salary range isn't provided
