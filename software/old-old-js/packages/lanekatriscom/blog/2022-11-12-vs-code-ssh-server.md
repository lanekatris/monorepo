I forgot how nice this is. Lately I've been using my windows pwersonal machine and using mobaxterm to connect to my home lab linux server. I'm messing around with docker and need to edit yaml. I use vim for this, until you need to multi-line comment. This is infuriating not being able to do it. Well at least I don't know how to do it. 

It is a far better experience to use VS code ssh serve because you get the power of your IDE, edit on that remote file system with git and all, AND run shell on that machine. 

Beautiful
