# Docusaurus Pitfalls

I just learned you can't link from one blog article to another in Docusaurus.

I wanted to do this, so you could filter by tag or just link to other blog article because it's relevant and I just want to link to it.

Apparently this is because of the [slug generation](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3250).

I suppose I can just link to related tags but the whole point of this was to keep data in blog posts instead of managing one page to give the concept of content over time. 

I don't think I'll drop docusaurus but I'll be on the lookout for others. I have a bad habit of switching technologies before I have a good foundation. Luckily, with markdown and images hosted externally, my content is rather portable.
