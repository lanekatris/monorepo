# Remembering Mom

It's about to be 2 years since she passed away and as I work on parsing her sci-fi short stories I thought I would share some more things to remember her by. 

These kinds of posts will be tagged with [mom](/blog/tags/mom). Also a limitation of Docusaurus with no blog to blog linking ☹️

## Digsby Logs

A looong time ago I used Digsby on my old laptop I gave to her. It installed for all users so it created a logs directory in your My Documents folder.

We IM'd via Google Chat and I suppose this was pre-that. I'm not sure though.

I looked at her profile folder and was surprised to see one file, from 2014:
