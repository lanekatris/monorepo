# Tools I Currently Use To Blog

### [Giphy](https://giphy.com/)
So much content out there for memes. I can find content easier here than DALL-E. I think that is because you have to creatively describe what you want and I'm not sure what I want...

### [DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com/)
Just started using this, but I really like the idea of adding images throughout your post to amplify its *vibe*

### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
This is my note editor, brain dump tool, to do list, etc.

It makes blog editing pleasent compared to my IDE of choice WebStorm

I use a seperate vault for this blog compared to my digital garden
