:::tip  
  
You have to keep the laptop **open** for all external monitors resolution to work properly (so that is 3 total monitors for me, 2 external + laptop)

### Background

I have two [ultra wide 34" monitors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YGZ7C1K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and of course I wanted to use them with this new PC

The laptop has two ports for display:
- USB-C 
- HDMI

My monitor accepts USB-C directly which is fantastic for Apple computers and I usually run:
- a closed laptop
- use both external monitors
- bluetooth keyboard
- usb mouse and web cam

:::caution  
  
I could not get the resolution to work correctly with the laptop closed

**FWIW** the Macbook Pro worked flawlessly closed with the two external monitors via USB-C ðŸ˜‰
