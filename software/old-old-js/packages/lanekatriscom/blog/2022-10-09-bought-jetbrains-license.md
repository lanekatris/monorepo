# Bought JetBrains License

I may have been dishonest in my past by using an `.edu` email to get JetBrains products for free...

I am now paying. $300.

But, I love there products, I use 3 of them:
- Webstorm
- Rider
- DataGrip

So they deserve the money and I can afford it. Time to be an adult and a professional ðŸ˜‰
