# Raindrop.io Added To My Productivity Apps

I don't want to spend time to re-create all the features of raindrop.io. 

I'm using it for bookmarks and Recipes. I'm thinking about adding "to buy" links to it.

I just got the desktop application and it's pretty sweet (same experience as their website).
